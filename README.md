## Overview

Banking-ATM is a Java-based simulation tool that models essential banking operations through an interactive command-line interface. Designed for educational purposes, it demonstrates core object-oriented principles such as user management, transaction tracking, and secure account handling. This project was created for my Intro to Java class for Butler Community College 

**Why Banking-ATM?**

This project helps developers understand and build banking systems by providing a modular, extendable architecture. The core features include:

- 🧾 **User Management:** Securely manages user identities, PINs, and account associations.
- 💰 **Transaction Tracking:** Records detailed transaction histories with summaries for easy review.
- 🏦 **Banking Operations:** Supports user creation, authentication, deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
- 🖥️ **Interactive CLI:** Enables seamless user interaction with banking services via a command-line interface.
- 📊 **Account Modeling:** Represents individual accounts with balance calculations and transaction management.
